 -0. Introduction
 ----------------
 
 This package contains all the necessary files to execute the test project for Selenium - Cucumber. 
 The tests consists on one test case. The script opens a new browser session, that opens the Google.es page and set "automatizaci√≥n" in the search input control.
 When Google completes the search, the sript looks for the Spanish Wikipedia entry in the list and opens it. Finally, the script goes to the section "Historia temprana"
 and takes one screenshot. This screenshot is stored in the Cluecumber html report that you can find in the folder "./target/Test_report".
 
 To see the screenshot go to the last step of the report and click on the link "Toogle".
 
 Finally, this project was initially planned to use Selenium Grid. Due to time constrains and a non-resolved bug, the project was reconverted to Selenium Webdriver.
 it will be generated a new version of the project with Selenium Grid RemoteDriver for the future.
 
 -IMPORTANT NOTE-: To check how the code works, we recommend to delete the folder "./target/Test_report", BUT I have kept it to demonstrate how the code is working in my machines, 
 in case that a non expected issue appears in your machine.
 
 -1. Requeriments
 ----------------
 All the necessary files are included in the project. 
 
 The project has been developed to use TestNG and Cucumber frameworks in order to have a very flexible configuration between hardware-software settings and test cases.
 
 In addition to that, this Maven project allows to be integrated in a CI/CD environment. The test results are stored in a Cluecumber report that allows the tester 
 (or other people involved in the project) to check the test results and email it to other people involved in the project.
 
 In case you plan to execute the test in a Windows system, it is mandatory to set the parameter "isDebug"
 as "Yes" in the file ./src/test/resources/Test_Suites/Test_Cucumber_Report.xml before to execute the tests.
 
 -2. Recommended modules
 -----------------------
 In addition to the previous point, we recommend to check if you have installed the following modules before to run the test project:
 	-If you are planning to run this test in chrome web browser and windows operative system, it is mandatory to have previously installed the version 106.0.5249.119
 	-It is mandatory to install java jdk 1.8.0. After that, we need to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME with the path to the folder where we have installed this java package.
 	-In addition to the previous point, we recommend to check the run configuration in your Eclipse IDE and be assured that you are using this Java jdk version.
 	-It is mandatory to install the Apache Maven 3.8.6. You can download it in this link: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
 	 To install Maven you need to follow these instructions: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
 	-You need also, to create and set the environment variable M2_HOME with the folder path where you have installed your Maven version.
 
 -3. Installation

 and selecting the option "Run as/Maven test".
 
 You can also doing a right click on ./src/test/resources/Test_Suites/Test_Report.html and select the option "Run as/TestNG suite".
 
 -4 Configuration
 ----------------
 
 You can select the browser and operative system where you want to run the tests. To do that, edit the file ./src/test/resources/Test_Suites/Test_Cucumber_Report.xml.
 The browser can be selected, editing the parameter "myBrowser". You can select between "chrome", "firefox" and "internet explorer". 
 There is not support yet for Safari or mobile devices browsers in this version of the project.
 
 You can select to execute the browser in a Windows or a Linux system using the parameter "isDebug". If this is set to "Yes", the code will use the Windows version of the webdrivers included in the project.
