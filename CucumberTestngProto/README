 -0. Introduction
 ----------------
 
 This package contains all the necessary files to execute the test project for Selenium - Cucumber. 
 The tests consists on one test case. The script opens a new browser session, that opens Demoblaze page, loks for the "Sony vaio i5" and "Dell i7 8gb" laptops and adds them to the cart.
 Then the code deletes the laptop "Dell i7 8gb" from the cart.
 Finally, check the current price of the chart, fill all the mandatory fields, check the order ID and compare the price displayed in the cart to the one present in the order summary.


 The test includes a Cluecumber report that is located in the folder ./targer/Test-report.To see the report, open the file "index.html" in your web browser.
 The last step of every single test include an screenshot. To see the screenshot, go to the last step of the report and click on the link "Toogle".
 
 -IMPORTANT NOTE-: To check how the code works, we recommend to delete the folder "./target/Test_report", BUT I have kept it to demonstrate how the code is working in my machine, 
 in case that a non expected issue appears in your machine.
 
 -1. Requeriments
 ----------------
 All the necessary files are included in the project. 
 
 The project has been developed to use TestNG and Cucumber frameworks in order to have a very flexible configuration between hardware-software settings and test cases.
 
 In addition to that, this Maven project allows to be integrated in a CI/CD environment. The test results are stored in a Cluecumber report that allows the tester 
 (or other people involved in the project) to check the test results and email it to other people involved in the project.
 
 In case you plan to execute the test in a Windows system, it is mandatory to set the parameter "isDebug"
 as "Yes" in the file ./src/test/resources/Test_Suites/Test_Cucumber_Report.xml before to execute the tests.
 
 -2. Recommended modules

 	-If you are planning to run this test in chrome web browser and windows operative system, it is mandatory to have previously installed the Google Chrome version 106.0.5249.119
 	-It is mandatory to install java jdk 1.8.0. After that, we need to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME with the path to the folder where we have installed this java package.
 	-In addition to the previous point, we recommend to check the run configuration in your Eclipse IDE and be assured that you are using this Java jdk version.
 	-It is mandatory to install the Apache Maven 3.8.6. You can download it in this link: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

 ----------------
 
 You can select the browser and operative system where you want to run the tests. To do that, edit the file ./src/test/resources/Test_Suites/Test_Cucumber_Report.xml.
 The browser can be selected, editing the parameter "myBrowser". You can select between "chrome", "firefox" and "internet explorer". 
 There is not support yet for Safari or mobile devices browsers in this version of the project.
 
 You can select to execute the browser in a Windows or a Linux system using the parameter "isDebug". If this is set to "Yes", the code will use the Windows version of the webdrivers included in the project.
